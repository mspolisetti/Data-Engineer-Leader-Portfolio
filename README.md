### IoT Data / Data Science/Engineering

### [Failure Prediction for Array of Things Sensors](https://github.com/mspolisetti/AoTNodeHealthAnalysis)
The Array of things (AoT) project is an urban sensing project involving collaboration of the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As part of the new Smart Cities Initiative announced in 2015, AoT provides real-time, location-based data about urban environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. 

The purpose of this project was to develop data-driven evaluation of the existing AoT Node health and explain the various factors affecting Nodeâ€™s health.  In addition, our team developed a Machine Learning that can predict possible malfunctions based on historical data.

### [Geofence dataset for Warehouses using Python, Google Maps API]()

#
### [Geofences for Warehouses using Microsoft Buildings Dataset](https://github.com/mspolisetti/build_geofences)
Geofence Pipeline is a Python-based geospatial data processing project that computes dynamic geofence polygons from building footprint data.

Leveraging Dask for scalable processing and Shapely for geometry operations, the pipeline calculates building areas, applies area-dependent offsets to generate buffered geofences, and integrates seamlessly with Snowflake for data staging and updates. This project showcases efficient handling of large datasets, advanced geospatial computation, and robust cloud data integration.
